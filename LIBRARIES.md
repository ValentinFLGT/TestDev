# Framework 

   In order to get the job done, i used the Framework Ktor which allow us to create asynchronous client and server application. It has a DSL that helps us creating both Json objects and HTML documents. It's very effective when we want to create an REST API because they use HTTP Request.
   
# Libraries 

On the Web i saw two principals libraries commonly used :

* Multiplatform 
* Coroutines

I don't think i'm using any of these in my project. I must say that actually the concept of libraries is a bit dark to me. 
I think the only libraries used in this project are kotlinx and application in order to use the features they provides (such as routing, request ...)
