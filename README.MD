## Encountered difficulties 

First of all, i do not own this API, all credit must goes to Tensor Programming. You can visit his channel right here :

He made video on "How to create a REST API using Ktor" which helped me alot. All i did is adapt his code to the exercise.
 
When i first read the test, i was like "Ok, i'll do it" Basically i thought it will be something like creating an API using Laravel. I was wrong, i felt lost using an unknown language with an unknown framework moreover object-oriented which is a concept that i barely know.

With that being said, i didn't give up. I read all the documentations i found on Kotlin, Ktor, Gradle, Maven, Java, POM, POJO, IntelliJ ... I watched a lot of videos, which took me some times. Anyway even with all these resources i must say this is still hard for me to understand all the concepts and ideas.

Thanks to your test i learned a lot about Kotlin's syntax, JavaScript's concept, REST API and object-orient programming. When we started the Javascript's module wednesday, i successfully finished the three days work in one day ! Then i could focus on finishing this exercise ^^

I know it's not perfect but i put my hearth and my soul to get the job done ! Whatever the result i wanted to thank you for your attraction to me ! I'm really proud to go that far no matter what is the outcome. Once again, thank you ! :D
